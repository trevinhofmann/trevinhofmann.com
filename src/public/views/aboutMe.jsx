                <p>Hi! My name is Trevin Hofmann, and I am a twenty-year-old software engineering student in my third year at the <a target='_blank' href='https://www.msoe.edu/'>Milwaukee School of Engineering</a>. Software is more than a career and hobby; it is one of the most powerful mediums for improving the world. I am particularly enthusiastic about applied cryptography, and <a target='_blank' href='https://bitcoin.org/'>Bitcoin</a> is by far the most interesting project that I have found.</p>
                <p>My experience with software development began in middle school, when I started reading HTML and CSS tutorials from <a href='http://www.w3schools.com/'>W3Schools</a> and creating simple web pages. I was instantly hooked, and I learned PHP and SQL to expand my repertoire in high school. I also spent many math classes writing BASIC applications on my graphing calculator, including recreations of <a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game)'>Snake</a>, Tic-Tac-Toe, and <a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong'>Pong</a>.</p>
                <p>Shortly after moving to Milwaukee for school, I began developing remotely for <a href='https://www.bitalo.com/'>Bitalo</a>, working on projects such as a <a target='_blank' href='https://bitalo.com/mining'>Bitcoin mining pool</a>, <a target='_blank' href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.hofmannt.bwallet'>mobile wallet</a>, and <a target='_blank' href='https://market.bitalo.com/'>marketplace</a>. It was my great pleasure to have worked in San Jose during the summer of 2015 as a software engineer intern at <a href='https://www.paypal.com/'>PayPal</a>. I am currently considering internship options for this coming summer.</p>
