                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi! My name is Trevin Hofmann, and I am a twenty-year-old software engineering student in my third year at the <a target='_blank' href='https://www.msoe.edu/'>Milwaukee School of Engineering</a> (MSOE). Software is more than a career and hobby; it is one of the most powerful mediums for improving the world. I am particularly enthusiastic about applied cryptography, and <a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin'>Bitcoin</a> is by far the most interesting project that I have found.</p>
                <p>My experience with software development began in middle school, when I started reading HTML and CSS tutorials from <a target='_blank' href='http://www.w3schools.com/'>W3Schools</a> and creating simple web pages. I was instantly hooked, and I learned PHP, JavaScript, and SQL to expand my repertoire in high school. I also spent many math classes writing BASIC applications on my graphing calculator, including recreations of <a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game)'>Snake</a>, Tic-Tac-Toe, and <a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong'>Pong</a>.</p>
                <p>At MSOE, I have gained considerable academic experience working with Java and Python. In my spare time and through work experience, I have become very fluent with JavaScript. I have experience with <a target='_blank' href='https://nodejs.org/'>Node.js</a>, Facebook's <a target='_blank' href='https://facebook.github.io/react/'>React.js</a>, PayPal's <a target='_blank' href='http://krakenjs.com/'>Kraken.js</a> and <a target='_blank' href='http://paypal.github.io/nemo/'>Nemo.js</a>, <a target='_blank' href='https://jquery.com/'>jQuery</a>, <a target='_blank' href='http://gruntjs.com/'>Grunt</a>, and many more libraries and frameworks. My preferred preprocessors are <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/jadejs/jade'>Jade</a> for HTML and <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/stylus/stylus'>Stylus</a> for CSS.</p>
                <p>Shortly after moving to Milwaukee for school, I began developing remotely for <a target='_blank' href='https://www.bitalo.com/'>Bitalo</a>, working on projects such as a <a target='_blank' href='https://bitalo.com/mining'>Bitcoin mining pool</a>, <a target='_blank' href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.hofmannt.bwallet'>mobile wallet</a>, and <a target='_blank' href='https://market.bitalo.com/'>marketplace</a>. It was my great pleasure to have worked in San Jose during the summers of 2015 and 2016 as a software engineer intern at <a target='_blank' href='https://www.paypal.com/'>PayPal</a>. I am currently considering software engineering positions for after graduation.</p>
